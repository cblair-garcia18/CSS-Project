<p>This product is a shopping app for all snowboarders. It is essentially the same thing as going to a snowboard shop and talking to an expert without having to go to the store. Not all towns with riders have board shops, and even if there is one, that doesn’t necessarily mean that all riders are willing to get out, spend gas money, and talk to some stranger they don’t really know is credible, and not even look at all the options. This is the solution. The app looks at all snowboard shops, big and small. Everything from Burton, to Capita, to Signal. This makes this app essentially the world’s biggest board shop, and you can get there without ever leaving your house. But how does a rider get personalized suggestions like you do in a board shop? Easy, when you open the app for the first time, you enter your information into a profile. Height, weight, foot size, riding style, flex preferences, where you ride, how often you ride and for how long are all taken into consideration. If you spend your day lapping the park, riding rails and hitting jumps, you’re going to want a softer boot, and bindings that can take a beating. Custom Snow Shop does all that, without all the effort it would take to go to a board shop or open 30 different brand sites.</p>
