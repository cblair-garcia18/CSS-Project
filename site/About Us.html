<h2>About the Team</h2>
<p>The two of us are curently attending Whitworth University, hailing from computer science and psychology departments, with varying levels of experience in coding. We have decided to take on this project in order to use what know in coding and improve on it, and contribute to the snowboarding community in the process.</p>
<h2>Chris</h2>

<p>Chris is currently in his sophomore year at Whitworth University, 
and has experience in coding with HTML, C++, and C#, and currently learning Python. He lives in Spokane with his family, and enjoys video games and classic literature.</p>

<h2>Erin</h2>

<p>I was born in Manhattan, and moved to Connecticut. I now go to Whitworth and study psychology. My family all ski, and I learned to ski and ride at the tender age of three. I've worked as a ski and snowboard instructor for three years now with my older brother and twin brother, who also both ski and snowboard. I've worked with girl scouts as a camp counselor. I am the only person in my immediate family on the west coast. I don't know much about coding, but ask me that again at the end of this semester. </p>
